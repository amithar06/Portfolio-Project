## Key Questions and Analysis Goals

Here are some of the questions this project aims to analyze COVID-19 data and answer the following key questions:

- What is the likelihood of dying if you contract COVID-19 in a given country? 
- Which countries have the highest COVID-19 infection rates relative to their populations? 
- Which countries have seen the most COVID-19 deaths adjusted for population size? 
- What percentage of the population in each country has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose?
